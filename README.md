This is a repository to store the script artifacts for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.  

## nlp_imdb_classification  
- NLP IMBD Text Classification Project
- This exciting project is all about text classification using the awesome IMDB database! We're diving into the world of movie descriptions to sort them into different genres.
- We're using some cool methods and technologies like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and even neural networks.
- To make this happen, we've got our trusty tools: Sentence Transformer, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. They're all working together to bring this project to life! üé•üçø

## nlp_m&a_entity_recognition
- NLP Mergers and Acquisitions News Named Entities Recognition Project
- This project is all about spotting named entities in the exciting world of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) using news data from 2019. Basically, it scours through news articles to spot the names of people, organizations, and places.
- For this mission, we're putting our trust in the spaCy entity recognition model. It's our go-to tool to get the job done.
- Once we've identified these entities, we neatly organize the results into a JSON file. This way, it's super easy to analyze the data further if we want to.
- An important aspect of this project is evaluating the performance of the entity recognition model. This can be achieved by comparing the results with those of other models, providing insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach.
- Additionally, exploring the use of large language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's for entity identification and comparison is another avenue for potential improvement and deeper analysis. üíµ

## nlp_amazon_review_topic_modeling
- NLP Amazon Product Review Topic Modeling Project
- This project is all about diving into the world of product reviews for a popular mobile phone sold on Amazon. We want to use topic modeling to uncover the key themes and ideas people are talking about in these reviews. It's like finding the main topics in a big conversation!
- To really get to the bottom of things, we're using some cool visual tools like pyLDAvis, WordCloud, T-SNE, and UMAP. These tools help us see the data from different angles and find interesting insights.
- We're not sticking to just one method here. We're using both traditional approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and newer techniques like BERTopic to analyze the data and make it easier for everyone to see what's going on in these reviews.
- Let's unravel the story together! üòä
