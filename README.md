# nlp  
This is a repository to store the script artifacts for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project.  

## nlp_imdb_classification  
- NLP IMBD Text Classification Project
- This project is centered around text classification using the IMDB database. In particular, it leverages movie descriptions to categorize movie genres.
- Methods and technologies employed include TF-IDF, word embeddings, and neural networks.
- Key packages utilized encompass Sentence Transformer, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for various aspects of the project.

## nlp_m&a_entity_recognition
- This project is all about recognizing named entities in the context of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) using news data from 2019. Specifically, it sifts through news articles to identify individuals, organizations, and geographical locations.
- The project relies on the spaCy entity recognition model as a key tool for this task.
- The results of the named entity recognition process are saved in a JSON file, which makes it convenient for subsequent analysis if needed.
- An important aspect of this project is evaluating the performance of the entity recognition model. This can be achieved by comparing the results with those of other models, providing insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach.
- Additionally, exploring the use of large language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's for entity identification and comparison is another avenue for potential improvement and deeper analysis.
